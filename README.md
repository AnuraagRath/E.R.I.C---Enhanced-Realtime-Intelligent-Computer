Enhanced Realtime Intelligent Computer or simply E.R.I.C is a simple Assistant that can get a lot of stuff done for you. He can open SubReddits, Launch Apps, Create folders, tell you about the weather, tell you Jokes and what not. Take good care of him. He's a good friend

# Running E.R.I.C
* Clone the repo and first install all the required python modules and libraries using requirements.txt
* Run the Python app
* When you say 'jobs', ERIC will list all the jobs he is obligated to perform

Have fun. Would love it if you had recommendations and if you are able to improve him

Thank You

Yours Truely,
